 		<cite>Islam</cite> is a natural and complete way of life. It encourages one to give due attention to their relationship with their Creator (God). It teaches that people find true lasting happiness and peace through being close to God, following His guidance and performing good deeds. 
 	</p>
 	<p class="text-center col-md-12">
 		Muslims constitute approximately one fifth of the world's population, making Islam one of the largest religions. Belief in and worship of the One True God is the purpose of life and cornerstone of Islam. 
 	</p>
 	<p class="text-center col-md-12">
 		The Arabic word "Islam" literally means "submission" to the One True God alone. One who voluntarily surrenders their will to God is called a Muslim, who can be from any racial or ethnic background. A distinguishing feature of Islam, unlike many other religions, is that it is not named after a person or tribe.

    	<h4 id="Belief">Belief in Allah</h4>
    	<img src="download.jpg" class="float-right">
    	<p>
    		"Allah" is the unique Arabic name of The One True God. Allah has no rivals, partners, equals, children or parents. He is not like His creation, as nothing shares His divine essence and perfect attributes. Some of His names and attributes include: The Creator, The Most Merciful, The Most High, The All-Powerful, The Most Just, The All-Wise, The Sustainer and The All-Knowing. </p>
<p>
He is the Creator and Sustainer of all, the One who has granted us countless blessings, such as our faculties of hearing, seeing and thinking, as well as the ability to walk, talk and be productive. As such, we should acknowledge, thank and worship Him alone by following His guidance.</p> 
<p>
It is rational to conclude that such a complex and balanced universe is not possible by any other than a powerful and intelligent being. It is therefore illogical to believe that the universe created itself, or was the result of random or coincidental events.
    	</p>
    	<h4>Belief in the Angles</h4>
    	<p>Angels are made from light, have allocated tasks and never disobey their Creator. Details about a few have been revealed, such as Gabriel, who delivers God's message to the Prophets, and the Angel of Death, who takes the souls of people</p>
    	<h4>Belief in the Revealed Books</h4>
    	<p>Allah sent divine revelation to His Messengers as a guidance and mercy to mankind. These include the Torah and Gospel as originally revealed to Moses and Jesus respectively, and the Quran as revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon them all). 

The Quran is the literal word of God and the final revelation to all of mankind. There are many clear signs and miracles that it is from God, examples of which include:
<ul><li>Contains a simple, pure and universal message which appeals to Man's inherent beliefs about Almighty God.</li>
<li>Contains a unique style of language that is universally known as the pinnacle of Arabic eloquence and linguistic beauty - yet the Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) who was known, historically, to be illiterate.</li>
<li>Contains many scientific facts which have only been discovered recently despite being revealed over 1400 years ago.</li>
<li>Free from any errors or contradictions.</li>
<li>Preserved, word-for-word, since it was revealed in its original Arabic language, unlike other scriptures which have been distorted, changed or lost.</li></ul>
The most rational explanation for the many unique and miraculous aspects of the Quran is that it can only be from God. Together with the authentic sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), it is the primary source of Islamic knowledge.</p>
<h4>Belief in the Prophets</h4>
<p>
	Muslims believe that thousands of Prophets were sent by Allah, at least one to every nation, to convey God's revelation. These Prophets include Adam, Noah, Abraham, David, Joseph, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad (peace be upon them all). Their mission was to return people to the worship of the One True God, to serve as practical examples of how to obey God, and to guide people to the path of salvation. Prophets do not share in any part of God's divinity, and any type of prayer or worship towards the Prophets, or to God through them, is strictly forbidden and considered a violation of God's right to be worshipped alone.
